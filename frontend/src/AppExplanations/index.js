    It's often a shity website with plenty of adds that will send you funds half the time, only after asking you to input your email to send you spam later.  \n\
    `Harmony` had none for its mainnet, so here's one, without the crap you usually get on typical faucets";

    Transactions on Harmony network are dirt cheap. Forget Ethereum, forget BSC, we're talking about fractions of a cent for most transactions.  \n\
    So this faucet will only send you `0.001 ONE` - which is enough for you to stake or unstake your tokens to your validators, for instance  \n\
    With `0.001 ONE`, you can do `40` basic transactions on Harmony network ! \n\
    The goal of this faucet is not to make you rich but just to make the onboarding to Harmony smoother.  \n\
    You can use it up to `3 times a day`, for the most clumsy of us ðŸ™„  \n\
    Feel free to send some spare change at `one10u35m0pvfuj548mq552389y92rqcn4nk7gkyvl` to replenish the faucet once you're rich ðŸ¦„";
